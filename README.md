An OOP programming language I am making by following Crafting Interpreters.
https://craftinginterpreters.com/

I intend it to have a somewhat C-style syntax, as it is very terse and pretty flexible, without having types before declarations, instead having keywords.
I also don't want semicolons, as they are visual noise. 

I want the language to look something like this:
```v
pub struct HelloStruct {
    str: String
    something: Number = 3 // Default value
    
    new(something: Number, ...) {
        // Autogenerate constructor function with ..., will do `self.thing = thing` automatically.
        // Things explicitly assigned are not autogenerated
        self.something = Number.from(something)
        ...
    }
    
    pub method print() {
        // Method keyword for methods, don't need to use `self.` and distinguished from functions.
        println(str)
    }
}

interface Hello {
    function nice();
}

struct WhenThe: Hello {
    function nice() {
        println("Nice!")
    }
}

function main() {
    thing := new Hello()
    thing.print()
    array := new Array()
    other_array := [1, 2, 3, 4]
    array.push(1)
}
```

I will eventually port it to bytecode (as the book goes), and try making a type system for it.
